This working prototype was created for UNSW WIT's Annual Hackathon 2021, featuring our submission "Safe Roads".

SafeRoads is a google chrome extension that sits upon Google Maps, and displays a safety score for each of the recommended routes. This safety score is calculated by mainly looking at the number of car crashes on every road making up that route from the last 18 months.

This is the frontend repository, created with 24 hours, so keep that in mind while viewing it :]

setup:

clone the repo, and put it anywhere. 
go to chrome extensions tab, and select developer mode.
Then select the root of this repo in `load unpacked`

make sure you have the server running before this as described by https://github.com/Peedee2002/will-i-survive-this-drive-backend
